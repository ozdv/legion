            <p>
              You inspired your servant Frank Duff with a profound insight into
              the mystery of your Church, the Body of Christ, and of the place
              of Mary the Mother of Jesus in this mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his immense desire to share this insight with others and in
              filial dependance on Mary, he formed her Legion to be a sign of
              her maternal love for the world and a means of enlisting all her
              children in the Churchâ€™s evangelising work.
            </p>
            <p>
              We thank you Father for the graces conferred on him and for the
              benefits accruing to the Church from his courageous and shining
              faith.
            </p>
            <p>
              With confidence we beg you that through his intercession, you
              grant the petition we lay before you .........
            </p>
            <p>
              We ask too that if it be in accordance with your will, the
              holiness of his life may be acknowledged by the Church for the
              glory of your Name.
